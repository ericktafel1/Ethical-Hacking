* A **penetration test** is an ongoing cycle of research and attack against a target or boundary. The attack should be structured, calculated, and, when possible, verified in a lab before being implemented on a live target. This is how we visualize the process of a penetration test:

* MegaCorpone.com and Sandbox.local Domains are **FICTITIOUS** created by OffSec
* **add new user (preferred) OR change default passwords** on Lab machines
* 12x reverts allowed per 24h - **revert** at start of scan and attack & once you are done with the machine
* **Create** a directory to store exploits. **Delete** when done with machine & revert.
